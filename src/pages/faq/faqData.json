        "question": "Why am I seeing the message, \"For security reasons, your session is no longer valid. Please sign in again.\"?",
        "answer": "This error appears when your current session token has been revoked. Our system uses token versioning—a security feature that invalidates all previously issued tokens when you log in on a new device or browser. This means your token from an older session is no longer valid, and you need to sign in again."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is token versioning?",
        "answer": "Token versioning is a method we use to enhance security. Each JWT (JSON Web Token) includes a tokenVersion number. When you log in, your token is issued with the current version stored on our server. If you log in again (for example, on a different device), the server increments this version. All tokens issued with an earlier version are then automatically revoked."
      },
      {
        "question": "I logged in on my mobile device and then on my desktop. Why does my desktop now show an error?",
        "answer": "Because logging in on your mobile device updated your token version, any previously issued token—including the one on your desktop—becomes outdated. This is intentional to ensure that only your most recent login session remains valid. You'll need to log in again on your desktop."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use multiple sessions simultaneously on different devices?",
        "answer": "With our current global token versioning implementation, logging in on any device revokes tokens on all devices. This is a security measure to protect your account. If you require simultaneous sessions on multiple devices, an alternative approach using per-session tokens would be needed. However, for admin dashboards and sensitive applications, global token versioning is preferred for its simplicity and heightened security."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does revoking old tokens protect my account?",
        "answer": "If an old token were to fall into the wrong hands, it could be used to access your account. By revoking all tokens from previous sessions whenever you log in on a new device, we ensure that only your latest, valid token can be used. This greatly reduces the risk of unauthorized access."
      },
      {
        "question": "I didn't explicitly log out. Why is my session still invalid?",
        "answer": "Even if you haven’t logged out, signing in on a new device or browser automatically increments your token version. This invalidates tokens from any earlier session to protect your account, so you might see the error if you try to use an older session token."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I do if I see this error message?",
        "answer": "Simply sign in again on the device where you see the error. This will generate a new token with the correct version, and your session will be restored."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this error a sign of a system bug?",
        "answer": "No. This error is an intentional security feature designed to protect your account. It ensures that if you log in on a new device, all older sessions are automatically invalidated."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I avoid this error if I want to use multiple devices?",
        "answer": "With global token versioning, this behavior is by design. If you need to maintain active sessions on multiple devices, you would require a per-session token strategy. However, for our admin dashboard, global token versioning is implemented to maximize security."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who should I contact if I continue experiencing issues?",
        "answer": "If you continue to see this error unexpectedly or if you have any concerns about your account’s security, please contact our support team for assistance."
